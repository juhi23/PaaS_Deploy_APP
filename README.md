# PaaS open source solutions demonstrated by deploying a Diet Share App
This project report is an exploratry research on PaaS (Platform as a service) which also presents a comparative analysis of the various PaaS OSS availble in terms of:

- Architecture &
- Performance, Interoperability and Scalability 

The OSS particularly discussed and compared for this report includes the following:

- Pivotal Cloudfoundry
- Appscale
- Redhat Openshift 
- Apache Stratos

To demonstrate the functionality of these OSS, an App - *DIET SHARE* is developed on the LARAVEL Framework and deployed on Cloudfoundry and Openshift OSS. The report also provides the challenges faced and the solution adopted while deploying the app with the essential commands.
